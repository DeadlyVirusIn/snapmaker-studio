# Why Snapmaker Studio needs to exist

The honest version of the question: *the U1 already has a slicer, several slicer
forks, five converters, six dashboards, ten model editors and a very popular
custom firmware. What is left?*

The answer is not another thing that acts on a file. It is the thing that
explains one.

---

## 1. The gap, stated plainly

Every mature project in the U1 ecosystem **does something to a file or a
machine**. A slicer turns a model into toolpaths. A converter rewrites a profile.
A dashboard sends and watches. An editor makes geometry.

Not one of them **tells a person what is about to go wrong, and why**.

That gap is not a market analysis; it is what the failure looks like in practice.
A beginner downloads a model, opens it in Snapmaker Orca, and gets:

> `Object is out of bounds`

No object name. No reason. No suggestion. The community answer is "hit Arrange
and hope". The actual cause might be that the project was authored for a 350 mm
bed and the part is sitting at X=300 — which is not a size problem at all, so
every size check in every tool passes.

Studio's job is to make that sentence say:

> Object 2 (40 × 40 × 25 mm) hangs 32.5 mm past the right edge, because this
> project was made for a Bambu Lab X1 Carbon and carries its coordinates. The
> whole arrangement fits — move it onto the plate? Your original file is not
> changed, and the layout, rotation and scale stay as the creator set them.

## 2. The positioning

> **Orca slices. Fluidd monitors. Studio decides.**

Studio is the layer between *finding a model* and *committing filament to it*.
It is deliberately not:

- a slicer — one-way handoff only, and this is a hard rule in the codebase
- a printer dashboard — Fluidd already ships on the machine
- a firmware fork — stock firmware users are first-class
- a converter — conversion is one step inside a larger job, not the product

## 3. The moat

Four properties, each of which is hard to copy for a *different* reason.

### 3.1 Evidence-graded honesty

Every fact Studio reports carries the part of the file that proved it and one of
four confidence tiers: **Confirmed**, **Likely**, **Informational**, **Unable to
determine**. An unmeasured value never becomes a `false`; it stays unknown, and
an unknown value never triggers a recommendation.

This is not a feature that can be bolted on later — it is a constraint on every
line of the engine, enforced by tests that assert Studio *refuses* to claim
things. `test_ecosystem.py::test_unmeasured_traits_never_fire_a_rule` and
`test_project_cost.py::test_unsliced_project_gets_an_explanation_not_a_number`
exist precisely to keep the product from drifting into confident guessing.

A competitor can copy a feature list in a week. Rebuilding on a discipline of
calibrated uncertainty means rewriting everything.

### 3.2 Ecosystem interoperability intelligence

Studio reads what a project actually contains and names the *community* tool that
fits it — including tools built by other people in this competition.

- Mixed nozzle sizes in the file → FOrcaSlicer, and why.
- Image-texture parts in the archive → OrcaSlicer ImageMap, and why.
- Already sliced → U1 Print Hub, because the next step is a printer, not a slicer.
- Nothing special → Snapmaker Orca, and Studio says so plainly.

The registry is a JSON file. Adding a tool is a pull request, not a code change.
This makes Studio *complementary* to the rest of the field rather than competing
with it, and it is the one position in this ecosystem that gets more valuable as
the ecosystem grows.

### 3.3 Reversible fixes with proof

Studio's fixes follow one shape: **diagnose → explain → fix → validate → keep the
original**.

The plate-placement fix is the clearest example. It rewrites only the translation
component of build-item transforms; a test byte-diffs the input and output
archives and asserts that `3D/3dmodel.model` is the *only* entry that changed.
After writing, it re-runs the same check against the file it actually produced —
not against what the code intended to produce — and reports failure if the result
is not what was promised.

For multi-plate projects it *measures* the plate grid the file uses, verifies the
measurement explains every plate, and refuses outright when it does not. A
half-moved plate is worse than an honest "open this in Orca and use Arrange".

### 3.4 Local-first, with nothing to trust

No cloud, no account, no upload, no telemetry. Untrusted 3MF files are read
through a hard byte budget so a decompression bomb is refused rather than
swallowed. Printer addresses are validated before they become request URLs.
Studio never takes autonomous control of a printer and never starts a print.

## 4. Against the field, one by one

| If you already have… | Studio still does something they cannot |
|---|---|
| **Snapmaker Orca** | Explains *why* before you slice. Orca's diagnostics are settings-level; Studio reads geometry, placement, provenance and cost |
| **A MakerWorld converter** | Verifies its own output, works on any local file from any source, and explains every change instead of asking you to review manually |
| **U1 Print Hub** | Everything before the file exists. The Hub starts where Studio finishes |
| **FOrcaSlicer / ImageMap** | Tells you they are the right tool for *this* file. Neither can tell you it should have been used |
| **Extended Firmware** | Works identically on stock firmware, and never claims a capability it has not detected |
| **A model editor** | Reads what you downloaded rather than what you authored |

---

## 5. Against the Fund's own criteria

**Innovation & Technical Depth.** Independent 3MF forensics with graded
confidence; measuring a multi-plate grid from the file rather than assuming it;
a data-driven ecosystem recommender; costing from the slicing result the project
already carries. The hard problems here are about *correctness under uncertainty*,
which is a harder class of problem than adding a feature to a slicer.

**Openness & Quality.** MIT. Every capability is reachable from a documented
JSON API and a CLI, so other tools can consume Studio's analysis without the app.
The ecosystem registry is a data file with a documented schema and a test that
rejects a rule keyed on a trait Studio does not measure. Documentation ships with
the code and is written for contributors as well as users.

**Practicality & Adaptability.** The problems it solves are the ones people
actually hit: a project made for another printer, an unexplained "out of bounds",
not knowing what a print costs, and not knowing which of forty community tools to
reach for. Nothing in the architecture is U1-only by construction — capability is
read from the machine, and the bed rectangle is read from a profile, not
hard-coded into each check.

**Community.** Studio's weakest axis today, and the honest reason is visibility
rather than substance: the repository has far fewer stars than the leading
entries. The response is the ecosystem registry — a project that points people at
*other* community tools earns its place in the community, and every project named
in that registry has a reason to care that Studio exists.

## 6. What would make this answer weak

Kept here deliberately, because a strategy document that lists no failure modes
is marketing.

- **If Studio started slicing.** It would become a worse Orca fork instantly.
- **If it required Extended Firmware.** It would abandon most U1 owners.
- **If it claimed certainty from heuristics.** The entire moat is the grading.
- **If the ecosystem registry became a link farm.** Each entry has to earn its
  place from a trait actually read out of a file — enforced by a test.
- **If it grew a second printer dashboard.** Fluidd is already on the machine.

The current answer is strong because Studio occupies the one position that gets
*more* useful as everything around it improves.
