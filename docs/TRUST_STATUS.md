# Trust Status — Snapmaker Studio

Honest, current verification state for the latest beta. This file does **not**
mark a release "accepted" until the interactive install acceptance below is
completed and recorded.

## v0.4.0-beta.20.3 — PARTIAL / PENDING (not accepted)

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| Installer integrity / SHA256 | **PASS** |
| Backend / sidecar boot | **PASS** |
| STL Project Doctor — design score, no CLI text | **VERIFIED** |
| Business Doctor — manual grams entry | **VERIFIED** |
| Object spacing / collision honesty | **VERIFIED (honest "unknown")** |
| Support-enforcer-without-support warning | **VERIFIED** |
| Interactive GUI install smoke | **PENDING (Kunal)** |
| Installed-app acceptance | **PENDING (Kunal)** |
| Overall trust status | **PARTIAL / PENDING — not accepted** |

### What changed (most recent first)

- **beta.20.3 — STL Project Doctor consistency.** A readable STL now gets a real
  design-health score (mesh quality) instead of "—", and the GUI no longer shows raw
  `repair` command-line text — it reads "Create a U1 profile copy, then review it in
  Snapmaker Orca" with a Prepare U1 copy step. Design health and U1-profile
  preparation are shown separately; a healthy STL is never called "ready". (Verified:
  a real STL with readable geometry scores from its mesh, no CLI text.)

Earlier (beta.20.2) — gaps on complex multi-object 3MF projects, fixed:

- **Cost & Pricing Doctor — manual grams.** When Studio can't read grams/volume,
  the calculator no longer dead-ends; it shows the assumptions form, and manual
  grams + Recalculate produces cost / suggested price / profit. (Verified: a file
  with unreadable geometry returns no cost until grams are entered, then computes
  from the entered weight.)
- **Object spacing / collisions — honest "unknown".** Studio does **not** yet
  verify object-to-object spacing for multi-part 3MF layouts (Bambu instancing /
  source_object_id / part matrices / assemble-vs-build coordinate semantics are not
  implemented). An attempted bounding-box detector mis-placed instanced objects —
  it flagged the wrong objects and missed the real Orca-reported collision — so it
  is **intentionally not shipped**. Instead the Project Doctor, Compatibility Doctor
  and Intelligence Report report spacing as unknown: they never say
  ready / no issues / no major blockers for a multi-object plate, and direct the
  user to check Orca for too-close / collision warnings. (Verified on two real
  multi-object files: both report not-ready + the spacing warning.)
- **Support enforcers vs support.** The Compatibility Doctor warns when a model has
  support enforcers but support generation is disabled. (Verified on a real file.)

### Automatically verified (3 clean-room checks passed)

1. **Installer integrity.** Release asset SHA256 =
   `ac69c78ceb081054066378258603c7abd98bf1d0fb66f706a64d5e4460a6acd9`
   (size 15,882,349 bytes). Valid Windows installer.
2. **Backend / sidecar boot.** The re-frozen engine sidecar starts standalone (no
   Python on host) and prints its `{port, token}` handshake.
3. **Business Doctor / spacing / enforcer behaviour** verified in code + unit tests
   (backend 321 passing; frontend tsc clean, 138 passing).

### What is NOT verified / NOT claimed

- The interactive GUI install smoke + installed-app acceptance were **not run** —
  install → launch → open STL/3MF → prepare U1 copy → open in Orca → close/reopen →
  uninstall require a hands-on Windows session. **beta.20.2 is not accepted** until
  these pass.
- Studio does **not** detect object collisions / boundary / bed-clearance itself —
  these are reported as **advisory / not verified** and must be checked in Snapmaker
  Orca. Real Orca-equivalent collision + boundary/clearance detection is deferred to
  a later release (beta.20.3).

### Product truths (always true)

- Studio prepares **U1 profile copies for review in Snapmaker Orca**.
- Studio **does not slice** — Snapmaker Orca does.
- **Originals are never modified** — preparing a model writes a new copy.
- **No print-success guarantees.**
- **Object placement / scale / spacing / bed-boundary fit remain advisory** and must
  be verified in Snapmaker Orca before slicing. No Orca PartPlate-equivalent
  validation is claimed.

## Acceptance checklist — for Kunal to complete (beta.20.3)

Run on a clean Windows environment / VM / fresh user profile. Tick each; flip the
status to ACCEPTED only when all pass:

- [ ] 1. Install app
- [ ] 2. Launch from Start Menu
- [ ] 3. Open STL
- [ ] 4. Open 3MF
- [ ] 5. Project Doctor works (multi-object 3MF shows "spacing not verified — check Orca")
- [ ] 6. Compatibility / Prepare U1 copy works (original intact)
- [ ] 7. Output opens in Snapmaker Orca
- [ ] 8. Cost & Pricing Doctor: unreadable file shows the form; manual grams + Recalculate gives cost/price/profit
- [ ] 9. Close app (no orphan sidecar process)
- [ ] 10. Reopen app
- [ ] 11. Uninstall app
- [ ] 12. Confirm uninstall (clean removal)
