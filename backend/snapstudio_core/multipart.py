"""One source object with several volumes, carried as several real parts.

PrusaSlicer stores an object's volumes as **triangle ranges inside one mesh**:
`<volume firstid="0" lastid="5">` and `<volume firstid="6" lastid="11">` describe
two parts of a twelve-facet cube, each able to carry its own filament. Studio used
to wrap that geometry verbatim and write one `<part>` record over it, so a source
saying "this half prints in filament 2 and that half in filament 5" arrived as one
undifferentiated object and the audit reported the second filament as not carried.

The target dialect can hold it. Two Snapmaker-Orca-family projects in the test
fixtures prove the shape:

    3D/3dmodel.model
      <object id="R" type="model">
        <components>
          <component p:path="/3D/Objects/object_1.model" objectid="1" transform=.../>
          <component p:path="/3D/Objects/object_1.model" objectid="2" transform=.../>
        </components>
      </object>
      <build><item objectid="R" .../></build>

    3D/Objects/object_1.model
      <object id="1" type="model"><mesh>…</mesh></object>
      <object id="2" type="model"><mesh>…</mesh></object>

    Metadata/model_settings.config
      <object id="R">
        <metadata key="extruder" value="…"/>       ← the object's own assignment
        <part id="1" subtype="normal_part">…<metadata key="extruder" value="2"/>
        <part id="2" subtype="normal_part">…<metadata key="extruder" value="5"/>

`part id` in the metadata, `objectid` on the component and the object id inside
the Objects file are **the same number**. That identity is what makes the metadata
describe the geometry rather than decorate it, and it is the thing this module
exists to get right — a `<part>` record over a single mesh is a claim, not a part.

Nothing here invents geometry. Each part's mesh is the source triangles of that
volume's range, with their vertices carried across unchanged and their attributes —
including the per-facet painting Studio spent two releases learning to read —
copied verbatim.
