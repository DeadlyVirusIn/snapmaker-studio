"""What should I load for this job, and what can stay where it is?

Once a job is sliced, its tool assignments are fixed: slot 3 prints what the
slicer decided slot 3 prints, and no amount of spool shuffling changes that
without re-slicing. So the useful question is not "how should the colours be
arranged" — it is the concrete one a person standing at the printer asks:

* which slots does this job actually use?
* which of those already hold the right thing?
* which do I have to change, and to what?
* which spools can I leave alone, or take out?

This is an intelligence layer over spool state, not a spool inventory. Studio
does not track filament, does not weigh it, and does not remember it between
sessions — U1Hub, Spoolman and OpenSpool exist and do that well. Studio reads
whatever spool state is available and answers the question above.

Material comparison is by family, because naming is not standardised: the printer
says "PLA Matte", the slicer says "PLA", and a strict comparison would report a
mismatch on every multi-material print ever made. Colour is advisory and always
labelled as such — a slicer's colour swatch is what the designer picked, not a
measurement of the filament on the shelf.
