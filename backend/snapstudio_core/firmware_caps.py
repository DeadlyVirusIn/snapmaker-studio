"""Firmware Capability Intelligence — read what THIS printer's firmware can do.

A Klipper machine's loaded object list is a truthful manifest of real features:
mesh levelling, input shaping, eddy-current probing, runout sensing, object
exclusion, pause/resume, multi-toolhead, and any custom macros the owner (or
extended/community firmware) has added. This turns that raw list into a
plain-language capability set, and flags when the firmware looks extended beyond
stock.

Nothing in here is particular to one manufacturer. Every feature is concluded from
a Klipper object being present, which is the same evidence on any printer running
Klipper behind Moonraker — the Snapmaker U1 that Studio was built against, and a
VORON, and anything else on that stack.

Read-only and honest: it reports only what the object list proves is present, and
never claims a capability it can't see.

# somebody has added their own — which may be a community firmware build, and may

# Counting them is a fact; concluding "extended firmware" from the count was not,
