"""Ready to send? — the last thing Studio says before a person presses the button.

Printer Hub can upload a sliced job and start it, and every one of those actions
already requires an explicit confirmation. This is what that confirmation should
be able to show: everything Studio can establish about whether this job, on this
machine, right now, is going to do what the person expects.

Three buckets, and the separation is the whole point:

* **Blocker** — a provable mismatch. The job asks for a tool the printer does not
  have; a slot it prints from is empty; it was sliced for another machine.
* **Warning** — a real concern that is not proof. A different colour is loaded; the
  printer is busy; the job pauses part-way through and nobody is standing there.
* **Unknown** — Studio cannot verify it. The fitted nozzle. Free storage on a
  firmware that does not report any.

An unknown is never promoted to a blocker to look thorough, and never demoted to
a pass to look clean. And nothing here sends anything: this module returns a
report, and a person decides.
