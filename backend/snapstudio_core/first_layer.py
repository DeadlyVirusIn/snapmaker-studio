"""First-Layer Intelligence — fuse the design with the printer's REAL measured bed.

This is not a bed-mesh viewer. It combines design geometry (footprint / contact area,
height, stability) with the U1's actual probed bed surface (from Moonraker) to answer
one question in plain language: **"Will this print's first layer stick on MY printer?"**

Pure + read-only: takes already-computed design metrics + reduced bed stats, returns
plain-language findings. No network here (the service layer gathers inputs).
