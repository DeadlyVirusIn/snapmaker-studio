"""Community Knowledge Doctor — MVP + architecture.

WHY: the U1 community has already diagnosed and fixed most recurring friction, but
that knowledge is scattered across Facebook groups, r/snapmaker, the Snapmaker
forums, and GitHub issues. A first-time user hits "out of bounds" and has to go
ask. This brings the known answer in-app.

ARCHITECTURE (staged):
  MVP (this file): a curated, offline knowledge base of the top recurring U1
    issues, each with symptom keywords, plain-language cause, the community's
    fix, and its source themes. `match()` maps a free-text symptom (or the
    Report's risk texts via `match_risks()`) to the relevant entries. The Report
    can then attach "the community's fix" to any risk it raises — evidence, not a
    new Doctor surface.
  Phase 2 (planned, not in MVP): periodic ingestion — pull + cluster public
    threads (Reddit API, GitHub issues API, forum RSS) into candidate entries,
    human-reviewed before they enter the curated set (never auto-published, to
    keep quality and avoid bad advice). Per-entry "helped / didn't help" feedback
    to rank fixes. All read-only, attributed, licence-respecting (link out, never
    rehost copyrighted posts).

HONEST: the MVP set is curated by theme, not scraped; entries cite where the
pattern is discussed, not individual users' words.
