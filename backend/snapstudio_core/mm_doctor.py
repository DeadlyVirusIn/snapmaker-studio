"""Multi-Material Doctor — does this multicolour print actually work on the U1?

The U1's headline feature is 4-toolhead multimaterial, and "my multicolour print
failed / printed wrong colours" is a top community pain that Orca doesn't explain.
This unifies the multicolour checks Studio computes separately — colours vs the
U1's toolheads, filament-settings consistency (Orca's "Customized Preset" trap),
and painted-region mapping — into one plain-language pre-flight verdict + fixes.

Read-only and honest: only meaningful for multicolour designs, uses the connected
U1's REAL toolhead count when known (else the U1's 4), and explains rather than
re-displays.
