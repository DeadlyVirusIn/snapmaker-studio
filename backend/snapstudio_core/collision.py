"""Object-spacing / collision honesty for the readiness model.

Studio does NOT yet faithfully resolve object-to-object placement for Bambu
instanced / multi-part 3MF layouts: source_object_id mesh reuse, per-part
matrices, and assemble-vs-build coordinate semantics are not implemented. So
Studio cannot tell whether objects on a plate are too close or colliding.

A wrong collision guess is worse than admitting we don't know — an earlier
bounding-box attempt mis-placed instanced objects (it flagged the wrong objects
and missed the real Orca-reported collision), so it is intentionally NOT shipped.
Instead we report an honest status that callers use to avoid any "ready / no
issues / collision-free" wording. Real, Orca-equivalent collision detection is
deferred to a later release.
