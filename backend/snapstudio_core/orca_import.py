"""Snapmaker Orca import compatibility — the fixes a foreign project needs to open cleanly.

A project authored in Bambu Studio for a Bambu printer usually *opens* in Snapmaker
Orca. What it does not do is open cleanly: features silently switch off, warnings
appear that name a setting rather than a cause, and in a few cases the slicer
refuses the file outright. Every rule in this module addresses one of those, and
each one records what it changed, what it was before, and why.

The dividing line, which matters more than any individual rule:

  **Compatibility is not intent.** Layer heights, speeds, temperatures, filament
  choices and support strategy are the creator's decisions and are carried through
  untouched — including in Preserve mode. What is corrected here is only the set of
  values that make Snapmaker Orca misbehave on a U1, regardless of what the creator
  wanted. A setting is only touched when leaving it alone produces a worse print or
  a broken import.

These behaviours are implemented independently from the publicly documented symptoms
they address (Snapmaker Orca / OrcaSlicer release notes, the U1 profile schema, and
the published behaviour of community converters). No third-party code or profile
data is used.
