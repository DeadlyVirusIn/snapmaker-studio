"""Toolhead-Fit Intelligence — does this design's colour count fit the toolheads?

Fuses the design's filament/colour count with the printer's REAL toolhead count
(from Moonraker when reachable, else the profile of the machine Studio is
preparing for) into one plain-language answer: "Can my printer print all these
colours in a single run, or will it need a filament swap / remap?" Pure +
read-only; the service layer gathers the inputs.

The offline fallback used to be a module constant, `U1_TOOLHEADS = 4`, which meant
that with no printer connected Studio told everybody they had four toolheads. It
now comes from the profile of the printer the file is being prepared for, and the
answer says which machine it was measured against, so a number that came from a
profile never reads as a number that came from hardware.

This is insight, not telemetry: it turns two numbers the user already has into a
clear go / plan-a-swap recommendation, and never fabricates swap counts or times.
