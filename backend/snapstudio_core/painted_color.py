"""Painted multi-material colour, read from a project before anything is sliced.

Until this module existed, Studio could prove a project *had* painted regions and
nothing more, and said so: "painted colour cannot be classified without slicing".
That was true of the marker it was reading — a byte count — and untrue of the
file. The paint is in the project, in full, and it can be read.

What this reads, and what each fact is worth:

* **Which filament slots the painting references.** Exact. This is what turns a
  six-colour project with four toolheads from "cannot classify" into a real
  answer about which colours are actually needed.
* **How much of each object is painted.** Two different facts, kept apart:
  the number of painted facets, and the painted *area*. A mesh's triangles are
  not equal in size, so "40% of the triangles" is not "40% of the surface", and
  Studio reports both rather than letting one stand in for the other.
* **Where each painted colour sits in Z.** Reconstructed from the painted patches
  themselves and put through the object's own transforms, so the heights are the
  heights on the plate.

And what it deliberately does not answer: whether two colours land on the *same
printed layer*. Bounding heights that overlap do not prove a shared layer, and
proving one needs the slicer. :func:`coexistence` states which pairs are proven
separate, which are proven to overlap in Z, and which remain unknown — the last
being an honest answer, not a failure.

The layouts read here are the ones the PrusaSlicer and BambuStudio/OrcaSlicer
families publish and have kept stable for interchange. This is an independent
reader of a container format; the encoding itself lives in :mod:`paint_codec`.
