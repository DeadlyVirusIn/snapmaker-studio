"""Print Success Prediction — "will this actually print on my U1?", before you start.

Studio already knows, separately: whether the design is validation-ready, whether
its colours fit the toolheads, whether the first layer is risky, how healthy the
printer is, and whether this exact file has failed before. A novice has to read all
of those and judge. This synthesises them into one honest likelihood + the factors
behind it, so the answer to "should I hit print?" is a single read.

Pure read-only synthesis of signals Studio already has — no webcam, no AI vision,
no control, no new printer calls. Honest: it scores only the signals present, names
what's pulling the odds down, and stays calibrated (no false confidence).
