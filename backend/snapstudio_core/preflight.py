"""Preflight — does *this* project match *this* printer?

Studio already knew two things separately: what a project needs (traits, placement,
filament count, nozzle sizes, capability dependencies) and what a printer reports
(toolheads, bed volume, firmware capabilities, current state). Nothing joined them,
so the app could tell you a project used six filaments and, on another page, that
your printer has four toolheads — and never put those two sentences together.

This module is that join. It takes the project facts and the printer facts and
produces one list of checks, each with a result, the evidence behind it, how
confident Studio is, what it means for the print, and what to do.

The rule that matters most:

    **Not detected is not the same as not supported.**

Stock U1 firmware does not report which nozzle is fitted. That makes the nozzle
check `unknown`, and `unknown` is a real answer that tells the user to go and look —
it is never quietly rewritten as a pass or a failure. Every check here can return
`unknown`, and several usually do.

Read-only: this module never contacts a printer itself. It is a pure function over
facts gathered elsewhere, which is what makes every branch testable without hardware.
