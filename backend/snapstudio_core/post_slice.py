"""Post-Slice Doctor — what the printer is actually going to execute.

Everything Studio checked before this point looked at the *source project*: its
geometry, its materials, its settings. That answers "is this file sensible?". It
does not answer "is the thing I am about to press Print on going to work?",
because between the two sits a slicer that made hundreds of decisions.

This module reads the sliced job's own statements (`gcode.read_facts`) and joins
them to the printer as it is *right now*. The interesting failures live exactly
here and nowhere else:

* the job uses tool 2 and slot 2 is empty;
* the job was sliced for PETG and PLA is loaded;
* the job was sliced for a different machine entirely;
* the job needs object exclusion and this firmware does not list it.

None of those are visible in the project file, and none are visible on the
printer alone.

The honesty rules are the same as everywhere else in Studio. A fact the G-code
does not state is unknown. A printer that cannot be reached makes printer-dependent
checks unknown, never failed. Nothing here contacts a printer or changes anything:
it is a pure function over facts gathered elsewhere, which is why every branch is
testable without hardware.
