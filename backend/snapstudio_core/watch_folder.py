"""Notice the sliced job coming back, without watching the whole machine.

The workflow had one manual step left in it: after Snapmaker Orca sliced the
prepared copy, the user had to find the `.gcode` and hand it back to Studio. That
step is where the loop stopped feeling like one thing.

This closes it, deliberately narrowly:

* **One folder, chosen by the user.** Their slicer's export folder, picked once.
  Not the whole disk, not the home directory, and nothing is watched until they
  say so.
* **Polled, not daemonised.** The engine answers requests; it does not run
  background threads that touch the filesystem while nobody is looking. The app
  asks "anything new?" while the user is on the page that cares.
* **Only complete files.** A G-code file being written grows for as long as the
  slicer is exporting it. A candidate is offered only once its size has stopped
  changing and it ends the way a finished job ends.
* **Nothing leaves the machine**, and nothing is modified: this reads sizes,
  timestamps and file ends.

Which project a job belongs to is not decided here — `provenance.py` weighs that,
and an ambiguous answer is shown to the user rather than resolved by guessing.
