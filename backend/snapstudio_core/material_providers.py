"""Where Studio learns what filament is actually loaded.

Until now there was one answer: whatever the U1 reports over Moonraker. That is
the right default and it will stay the default, but it cannot answer the question
people keep asking — *do I have enough filament for this print?* — because a
printer knows which spool is in a slot and nothing about how much is left on it.

Other tools do know. Spoolman tracks spools and their remaining weight, U1Hub
keeps a loadout, and some firmware builds expose more than stock does. So this is
a seam, not an integration: each provider is read-only, optional, and normalises
to one shape that `material_plan` consumes without caring where it came from.

Three rules, and they are the reason this is a seam rather than a feature:

* **Nothing is required.** A stock U1 with no other software is a first-class
  setup and always will be.
* **Nothing is written.** Studio does not create, update, consume or delete
  anyone else's records. Reading someone's spool database and then quietly
  decrementing it is how two tools end up disagreeing about reality.
* **Nothing is invented.** A provider that cannot say how much filament is left
  reports `None`, and everything downstream treats that as unknown rather than
  as plenty.

Every service here lives on the local network at an address the user supplies,
exactly like the printer. Studio still makes no outbound internet requests.
