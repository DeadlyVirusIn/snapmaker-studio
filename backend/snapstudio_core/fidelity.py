"""Fidelity audit — what actually survived preparing a copy.

Every converter in this space tells a user the same thing: *converted*. None of
them tells the user what that cost. The interesting question is not "did it
work" — it is "what is different now, and what could not be carried over at all".

This module answers that by comparing the original project with the prepared copy
and classifying every element it can identify:

* ``preserved_exact``     — byte-identical
* ``preserved_semantic``  — the bytes moved but the meaning did not
* ``changed``             — deliberately different, with the reason
* ``removed``             — deliberately dropped, with the reason
* ``added``               — the prepared copy carries something new
* ``unsupported``         — data Studio does not understand well enough to judge
* ``unverified``          — Studio could not confirm either way

The last two categories are the point. A report that can only say "preserved" or
"changed" has to lie about the parts it does not understand, and those are
exactly the parts — Full Spectrum data, a slicer extension nobody has documented,
a vendor's private metadata — where a user most needs to know that nobody checked.

**Studio never claims nothing was lost unless this audit proves it for that
project.** ``claims`` at the end of the report is what public copy is allowed to
say, computed rather than asserted.
