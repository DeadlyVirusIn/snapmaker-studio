"""Telling Snapmaker Orca which process values this project does not inherit.

A project names a process preset in `print_settings_id` and then lists ~130 of
that preset's values inline. Studio assumed the inline values were the ones that
would be used. They are not.

Measured on Snapmaker Orca 2.3.6 by writing one value into an otherwise
byte-identical project, opening it and reading the project Orca saved back:

| project_settings said | Orca kept |
|---|---|
| `layer_height="0.28"`, deviation **declared** | **0.28** |
| `layer_height="0.28"`, deviation **not declared** | **0.2** — the preset's value |

The declaration is `different_settings_to_system`, and its shape is Orca's own.
Changing three values through Orca's own Global process panel and asking it to
Save Project As produced:

    "different_settings_to_system": [
        "initial_layer_print_height;layer_height;seam_gap", "", "", "", "", ""
    ]

So: entry 0 is the **process** preset's deviations, semicolon-joined and sorted;
the remaining entries belong to the filaments and the printer. The list Orca
wrote was six long for a four-filament project and seven long for a five-filament
one — one entry for the process, one per filament, one for the printer.

## Why this module exists rather than a comment

`u1_identity.normalize_presets` blanks every entry to clear Orca's "Customized
Preset" notice, and its comment said *"the customized values themselves stay in
the project (intent preserved)"*. That was measured to be false: blanking the
declaration is what makes Orca throw the values away. A project whose settings
were normalised for a clean import was silently getting the stock preset.

So the notice and the values are the same switch. Studio may have one or the
other, and the values are the project. What this module does is make the
declaration true: exactly the keys that deviate, and nothing else, so a project
that deviates in nothing still imports without a notice.
