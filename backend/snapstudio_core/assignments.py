"""Which filament each object is assigned to, in whichever dialect says so.

A project's per-object filament assignment is the quietest thing a converter can
destroy. The mesh survives, the file opens, the colours are all still listed —
and every object prints in filament 1. Studio did exactly that to every
PrusaSlicer project it prepared: an object assigned filament 3 arrived assigned
filament 1, with nothing anywhere saying so.

So the assignment is read as a fact in its own right, from both dialects, in a
shape that can be compared across the crossing:

* **PrusaSlicer** — `Metadata/Slic3r_PE_model.config`, objects carrying
  `<metadata type="object" key="extruder">`, with volumes able to carry their own.
* **Bambu / Orca / Snapmaker Orca** — `Metadata/model_settings.config`, objects
  and their parts carrying `<metadata key="extruder">`.

Two distinctions are kept rather than flattened. An object with no assignment is
*default*, which is not the same claim as an object explicitly assigned slot 1.
And an object whose volumes disagree cannot be represented as a single U1 part,
which is a real limit of the crossing and is reported as one — never resolved by
picking a volume and hoping.
