"""Studio Intelligence Report — the Doctors become evidence, the Report is the product.

Every Doctor answers one question. A user shouldn't have to read seven cards to
know where they stand. This synthesises them into a single screen's worth of
answer: a Studio Intelligence Score, the money headline, the biggest risk, and
the one next action — with each Doctor's finding as supporting evidence.

Pure synthesis over already-computed Doctor dicts (no network, no fabrication):
it scores only what's present, surfaces real findings, and stays honest about
what it can't yet see.
