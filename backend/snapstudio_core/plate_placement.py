"""Plate placement — is each object actually *on* the U1's bed, and can that be fixed?

A project authored for another printer carries its objects at that printer's
coordinates. A 40 mm part sitting at X=300 on a 350 mm bed is small enough for the
U1 by every size check, and still lands completely off a 270 mm plate. Size checks
never catch it, because nothing is too big — it is in the wrong place.

Snapmaker Orca's answer to this is a bare "out of bounds", and the community's
answer is "hit Arrange and hope". This module gives the specific answer instead:
which object is off the plate, by how much and on which edge, whether one
translation would bring the whole arrangement back on, and — when it would —
writes a new copy with exactly that translation applied.

Discipline, in order of importance:

* **The original is never modified.** A fix writes a new file.
* **Only the placement changes.** The rewrite touches the translation component of
  build-item transforms and nothing else: no meshes, no painted colour, no
  settings, no other archive entry. Rotation and scale are carried through
  untouched, so the creator's arrangement survives.
* **It refuses rather than guesses.** If one translation cannot bring everything
  on-plate, it says so and stops. Multi-plate projects are never repositioned at
  all: the spacing between plates is not recorded in the file, so any move would
  be a guess. They are still *checked* — each plate is judged on whether its own
  contents fit a U1 plate, which does not depend on the grid — and the answer is
  "open this in Orca and use Arrange".

# --- multi-plate projects ----------------------------------------------------
#
# A slicer lays several build plates out on one coordinate grid, and the stride
# between them is not recorded in the file.
#
# Studio used to derive that stride from where each plate's objects happened to
# sit. An independent review reproduced the consequence: for two plates whose
# parts were off-centre, a true 370 mm stride was measured as 690 mm and the
# second plate was placed 745 mm along X — entirely off the bed — while the
# result reported success. The measurement was of the parts, not of the grid, and
# with only two plates the "does this stride explain every plate" check is a
# tautology.
#
# Rather than patch a number Studio cannot actually observe, the repositioning is
# withdrawn for multi-plate projects. What remains is the part that is sound: each
# plate is judged on whether its own contents *fit* a U1 plate, which does not
# depend on the grid at all. A plate's absolute coordinates on a multi-plate grid
# are an artefact of the authoring slicer, not a fault in the project — so an
# object at X=900 on plate 3 is not "off the plate", and Studio no longer says it
# is.
#
# Moving them is Snapmaker Orca's Arrange, and Studio says so.
