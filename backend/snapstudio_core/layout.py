"""Layout / plate-readiness checks for a 3MF (beta.18.4).

Profile compatibility is NOT the same as print readiness: a file can carry clean U1
settings yet still have objects placed outside the build plate (Orca's "out of bounds").
This module reads each placed object's *real* transformed bounding box (via
geometry.build_item_dims) and reports whether the arrangement is plate-ready.

Honest by construction: it only claims `pass` when it can actually verify the layout.
Multi-plate projects can't be fully verified from world-space bounds alone (per-plate
local coordinates aren't reconstructed here), so they return `warn`, never a false pass.

    pass via the centred window. Decide once per axis: if that axis's collective minimum is
    meaningfully negative the file is centred on that axis; otherwise corner-origin. Deciding
