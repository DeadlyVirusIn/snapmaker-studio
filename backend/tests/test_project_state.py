"""Guards against documents that describe a state the project has left behind.

This file exists because of a specific failure. Snapmaker Studio was submitted to
the Innovation Fund on 24 June 2026, confirmed on 29 June, and listed publicly
among the fund's 41 entries. Two months later a sprint read a stale document,
concluded the project had not been submitted, and reported "submit the form" as a
remaining human action. The stale document was believed over the live world.

Documents that describe the *current* state must not contain phrases that assert
a superseded one. Historical documents may — they just have to say so.
