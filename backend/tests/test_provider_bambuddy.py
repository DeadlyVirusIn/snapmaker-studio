"""What a real Bambuddy actually does, and what it hands Studio that cannot be true.

The second implementation of the material-provider seam, and the reason it is
Bambuddy rather than something Spoolman-shaped: it agrees with Spoolman about
almost nothing at the wire, so a normalisation that works for both is evidence
that the seam is a seam. Where Spoolman states a remaining weight inside a nested
filament object, Bambuddy has **no remaining-weight field at all** and keeps the
material, the variant and the brand as three flat fields.

A real Bambuddy 1.2.5.3 was run locally in Docker (session-owned, removed
afterwards) and seeded through its own documented REST API with ten controlled
spools. Four things it did were not what its documentation implies:

1. **Archived spools are omitted from the default listing** — ten spools with
   `include_archived=true` and nine without. Exactly the trap Spoolman set, in a
   differently-spelled parameter, and a slot mapped to an archived spool would
   otherwise read as deleted.
2. **`remaining` is not a field.** The wiki describes remaining weight as
   `label_weight − weight_used`; that subtraction happens in Bambuddy's own
   interface, and over the API Studio has to do it. So the figure is arithmetic,
   and it can never be presented as something Bambuddy is keeping.
3. **`last_used` is null on every spool**, including one whose weight had just
   been set through the scale endpoint. It is written by print consumption only —
   so an undated figure is the common case, which is what Spoolman turned out to
   be too, reached through a completely different schema.
4. **It accepts weights that cannot be true**: a negative used weight, a used
   weight far above the label weight, and a 99,000,000 g spool, all stored and
   returned without complaint.

The fixture beside this file is the captured response with its own provenance
block, so these findings stay pinned without needing Docker on every run.
