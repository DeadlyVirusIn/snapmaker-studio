"""Painting crosses into the target's dialect, or it is reported — never quietly.

Two things have to be true before Snapmaker Orca reads a facet's colour, and both
were measured against Orca 2.3.5 by handing it one file at a time and reading the
project it saved back:

* the attribute must be `paint_color`. The identical painting written as
  PrusaSlicer's `slic3rpe:mmu_segmentation` came back with nothing painted.
* the mesh must be in its own object file behind a component. The identical
  painting, in `paint_color`, left in the root model came back with nothing
  painted; moved behind a component it came back complete — eight facets, the
  same slots, the same areas.

The encoding itself is the same on both sides: the OrcaSlicer and PrusaSlicer
painted-cube fixtures carry byte-identical values for the same eight facets. So
crossing is a rename plus a move, and this file holds it to that — including the
control that shows Orca is reading the attribute rather than copying it: handed
a paint tree that cannot be decoded, Orca 2.3.5 rewrote it to an unpainted one.
