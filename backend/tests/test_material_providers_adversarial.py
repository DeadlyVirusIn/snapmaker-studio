"""Trying to make Studio believe the wrong thing about what is on the spools.

Two sources can describe the same slot: the printer, which is looking at it, and
an optional tracker like Spoolman, which knows things the printer cannot — a spool
identity, and how much is left on it. That second source is where the strongest
sentence Studio says comes from: *87 g needed, 43 g left, it will run out.*

A sentence that strong has to be built out of something better than a number in a
database. These tests are the ways that number can be wrong — missing, negative,
in the wrong units, from the wrong slot, describing a spool that has since been
swapped — and what Studio is allowed to say in each case.

The rules being defended:

* the printer is authoritative about what is physically loaded;
* a provider may add what the printer cannot know, and never overrides it;
* a disagreement is reported as a disagreement, not silently resolved;
* nothing is ever invented, and a figure that cannot be true is not a figure.
