"""Two providers, one set of decisions.

Studio has had a material-provider *seam* for several releases and exactly one
implementation behind it, which proves nothing: a seam with one implementation
is a function with an unusual name. This file is the second implementation's
reason for existing.

The claim under test is narrow and it is the whole point:

    Given two providers stating the same physical thing about a spool, in their
    own wire formats, everything downstream must reach the same decision — the
    same sufficiency verdict, the same blockers and warnings, the same
    confidence, the same conflict behaviour, the same send-check answer.

The only difference allowed anywhere in the result is the provider's *name*,
appearing as provenance on a fact. So the comparison scrubs the two names to one
token and then demands the results be equal — not similar, equal.

Each scenario is built from the **raw payload each provider actually returns**
and pushed through that provider's real adapter, because the seam is only proved
if the normalisation is part of what is being tested. Spoolman states a remaining
weight and hides the material and vendor inside a nested filament object;
Bambuddy has no remaining-weight field at all and Studio must subtract two
numbers to get one. If those two roads meet, the seam is real.

The wire formats here are not invented. They are the shapes captured from a real
Spoolman 0.26.1 and a real Bambuddy 1.2.5.3 — see the fixtures beside this file.
