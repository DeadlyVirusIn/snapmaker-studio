"""Reading a public document the way a reader does, so a stale claim is caught.

Studio's counts and links are checked against `docs/internal/evidence.json`, and
until v0.7.0 that checking was line-by-line: a claim only counted if the words
identifying it and the number itself landed on the same line. Three false claims
shipped in v0.7.0 through that gap, all of them obvious to a human:

* the README's top call to action still linked v0.6.2;
* "`u1convert selfcheck` … prints a 25-check pass/fail table" — the sentence wraps,
  so the word and the number were on different lines;
* "verified against the published v0.6.2 installer" sat directly above a table of
  v0.7.0's numbers.

So this module reads *blocks* — a paragraph, a list item, a table row — together
with the headings above them, which is the unit a claim actually lives in. A block
is exempt only when it or one of its headings says it is talking about the past.

Nothing here reads the immutable per-release snapshots; those are history and are
guarded separately in test_evidence_integrity.py. This is only about documents
written in the present tense.
