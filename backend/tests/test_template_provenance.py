"""The U1 base project may not accrete values nobody owns.

The template was captured from a real Snapmaker Orca project, so it states most
of its presets' values inline. That is mostly harmless and mostly pointless:
measured on Orca 2.3.6, a value a project states is only used when the project
also **declares** it deviates, and an undeclared value is replaced by the preset
the project names. A restated preset default is a comment the slicer overwrites.

Eight keys were removed because they were neither: they differed from the preset,
had no owning feature in Studio, and were replaced on load — so they had never
reached a print. The machine's own start and end G-code were among them, five
weeks out of date against the preset that owns them.

These tests keep that from happening again. Every key must belong to a group
`data/templates/PROVENANCE.md` describes, and every group has an owner in the
code.
