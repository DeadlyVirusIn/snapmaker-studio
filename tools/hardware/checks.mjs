// Read-only verification of the *installed* Snapmaker Studio against a real
// Snapmaker U1, driven over the Chrome DevTools Protocol.
//
// Why this exists: everything Studio says about a printer was, until beta.24,
// verified only against tests the project wrote itself. The first session against
// a real machine found a genuine bug — the U1 reports loaded filament as parallel
// arrays, and Studio was looking for a list of objects, so it told owners their
// printer does not report loaded filament while the printer was reporting all
// four spools. This script proves the shipped installer reads that firmware
// correctly, and that the honest unknowns are still honest.
//
// SAFETY. This script is read-only by construction:
//  * Only the routes in READ_ONLY_ROUTES are ever called, and the list is
//    asserted against a deny-list of every control route the engine exposes.
//  * Nothing is uploaded, nothing is queued, no temperature, motion, homing,
//    pause, resume, cancel, start, emergency stop or configuration call is made.
//
// PRIVACY. The printer's address never reaches the evidence file: it is replaced
// with a placeholder before anything is written to disk.
//
// Usage: node checks.mjs <cdpUrl> <outDir> <printerHost> <samplePath>
