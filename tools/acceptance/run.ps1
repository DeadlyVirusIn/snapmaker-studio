# Installed-build acceptance for Snapmaker Studio.
#
# Installs the built NSIS installer into an isolated directory, launches the
# installed application with its WebView2 opened for remote debugging, drives the
# real UI over CDP, then uninstalls and proves the machine is clean.
#
# Why this exists: every capability check before this ran against the dev server.
# That proves the feature works; it does not prove the installer ships it. This
# runs the shipped exe and the frozen sidecar.
#
# SAFETY, and these are not negotiable:
#  * Every process this script starts is tracked by PID and only those are ever
#    stopped. A Snapmaker Orca or other user process is never touched.
#  * The app runs with an isolated WebView2 profile and an isolated engine data
#    directory, so the maintainer's own library, recent files and settings are
#    neither read nor modified — which also keeps private model names out of the
#    screenshots this produces.
#  * If another Snapmaker Studio is already installed, its uninstall registry key
#    is exported first and restored afterwards.
#  * Nothing is installed to a shared location and nothing needs administrator.
#
# Usage:
#   pwsh -File tools/acceptance/run.ps1 [-Installer <path>] [-KeepInstall]
