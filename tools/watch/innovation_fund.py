"""Watch the Innovation Fund page for the project-voting system going live.

The fund's page says the community-vote system is still being built. Twenty per
cent of the Phase 1 score depends on it, and there is no announcement channel that
reliably reaches an entrant — so this checks the page itself, once a day.

It is deliberately minimal about what it does to the site: one GET per run, a
normal User-Agent, and nothing that resembles interacting with a vote.

    python tools/watch/innovation_fund.py            # compare against the snapshot
    python tools/watch/innovation_fund.py --update   # accept the current page as the snapshot

Exit codes: 0 = no meaningful change, 2 = signals changed (the workflow opens an
issue), 1 = the page could not be read.
